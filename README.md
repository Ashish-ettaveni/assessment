Hi This is Ettaveni Ashish

You need to install the Postgres db and create a table “sno, customer name, age, phone, location, created_at” with the following colums and insert records into the database.
connect the database to your express application by changing the database name and password in the db.js file

here are the packages you need to install to run the project succesfully.
first in backend folder 
1.cd backend
2. npm install these following packages
   express,
   colors,
   cors,
   pg,
   nodemon.
Second in the myapp(frontend) part
 1.cd myapp
 2.npm install axios react-paginate react-table

 you can check the package.json files for the exact dependencies.
 Thank You.
